    "Car accidents can occur all the time, however there are some conditions were the probabilities of have an accident arise due multiple variables. The Seattle government is going to prevent avoidable car accidents by developing the algorithm to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, not paying enough attention during driving, abusing drugs and alcohol or driving at very high speed are the main causes of occurring accidents that can be prevented by enacting harsher regulations. Besides the aforementioned reasons, weather, visibility, or road conditions are the major uncontrollable factors that can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and announcing warning to the local government, police and drivers on the targeted roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience of the project is local Seattle government, police, rescue groups, and last but not least, car insurance institutes. The model and its results are going to provide some advice for the target audience to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents and injuries for the city. The information was provided by Seattle Police Department from 2004 to 2020.\n",

    "### Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "* Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "* Numpy: for working with arrays, linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.\n",
    "* Scikit Learn: For importing KNN, decision tree and linear regression.\n",
    "* Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "* Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module."
